## General info

King's Castle Rebuild is a game created during #ZostanWDomuRóbGry GameJam. Topic of Jam was "Rebuild". 
This project was first attempt and introduction in game development for graphic designers, so the premise of the project was to complete it and gain the greatest experience.
Game is telling the story of king whose soul is binded to the castle. King is the most powerfull when castle is rebuild what is realized by cleaning rooms in game. Moreover king is gaining new skills after cleaning next rooms. Game is over when you strike down the evil prince.
If King didn't accomplish his mission he will return to the throne Hall, saving unlocked abilities but losing progress in unlocked doors. Maze is randomly generated each time kings die or start game. After cleaning 4, 7, 10 and 13 room kings throne hall is automaticly updated, which is a reference to kings soulbinding.
A lot of graphics left unused, we misscalculated the amount of time we had and any of us has experience with online game jams. We prepared sounds for the game but becouse of lack of time it's not in the game.
